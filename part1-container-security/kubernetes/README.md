Three best security features of Kubernetes are as follows.
a) RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): RBAC allows you to control who can access the Kubernetes API and what actions they can perform. It provides fine-grained control over access permissions.
b) Network Policies: Network policies allow you to control the traffic flow between pods. By defining policies, you can restrict which pods can communicate with each other, enhancing network security.
c) Use Gatekeeper: Gatekeeper is an open-source tool that enables you to audit and enforce policies on your Kubernetes cluster in an automated way.
