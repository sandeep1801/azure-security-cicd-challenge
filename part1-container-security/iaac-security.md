Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. IaaS allows businesses to rent IT infrastructure such as servers, storage, and networking on a pay-as-you-go basis.

Security Implications:

Shared Responsibility Model: Security responsibilities are shared between the cloud provider and the customer. The provider secures the underlying infrastructure, while the customer is responsible for securing their applications and data.
Access Control: Proper identity and access management practices must be followed to ensure that only authorized users can access the infrastructure.
Data Protection: Data encryption both in transit and at rest is crucial to protect sensitive information.
Network Security: Use of firewalls, VPNs, and network segmentation to protect against unauthorized access and attacks.
